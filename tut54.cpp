/*
Polymorphism are of two types in C++:
1. Compile Time Polymorphism -Compile time Polymorphism means the object is bound from the function call during the compile time.In this the compiler knows which fuction is going to work next
(Early Binding)               In hindi- Compile time m ye decision le liya jata h ki kon sa function call hone wala h to isse early binding bhi bolte h aur static binding bhi bolte h
                              Compile Time Polymorphism can be achieved in two ways:
                              1. Function OverLoading - app phale se apne function se bind ho chuke h although in overloading
                              2. Operator Overloading - app phale se apne operator se bind ho chuke h although in overloading
2. Run Time Polymorphism - It is acheived by 1.'virtual function'.
(No binding)               It knows which function to compile during run time of code
