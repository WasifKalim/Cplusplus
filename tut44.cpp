    Re-veiw the video for virtual class A
    There is one Virtual class A
    from which two derived class is formed that is B & C
    Both class B & C they combine and form class D.
    While forming D there will be porpertires of class A two times 

    Working:
    Both derived classes B and C have class A property
    So while forming D they ensure that D do not have the property of class A two times.
    Bacause porperty of Class A can come from Class B as well as Class C
    For this class A is made Virtual class to avoid class D to have properties A in class D two times.
